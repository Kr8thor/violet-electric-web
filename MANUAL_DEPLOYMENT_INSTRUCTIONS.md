# 🚀 Manual Deployment Instructions
## Due to GitHub Suspension - Alternative Deployment Methods

Your GitHub is suspended, so here's how to deploy the AJAX URL fix manually.

## 📁 Files Changed (Need to be updated):

### 1. src/App.tsx (UPDATED)
Added this import:
```typescript
// Fix for incorrect AJAX URL calls
import "./utils/ajaxUrlFix";
```

### 2. src/utils/ajaxUrlFix.ts (NEW FILE - CREATED)
Complete file created to fix AJAX URL redirects.

### 3. functions.php (WordPress - UPDATED)
Added AJAX URL fix in WordPress admin.

## 🔧 Manual Deployment Steps:

### Option A: Netlify CLI (Recommended)
```bash
cd C:\Users\Leo\violet-electric-web

# Install Netlify CLI if not installed
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Link to your site (if not already linked)
netlify link

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Option B: Manual Upload
```bash
# Build the project
cd C:\Users\Leo\violet-electric-web
npm run build

# Then:
# 1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/lustrous-dolphin-447351/deploys
# 2. Click "Deploy manually"
# 3. Drag the entire 'dist' folder to upload
```

### Option C: Alternative Git Service
1. Create account on GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org
2. Create new repository
3. Push your code there
4. Connect Netlify to new repository:
   - Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Link Repository

## 📋 WordPress Changes (Already Applied):
The functions.php changes were already applied to your WordPress site, so those are live.

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment:
1. Wait for deployment to complete (2-4 minutes)
2. Go to: https://wp.violetrainwater.com/wp-admin/ → Universal Editor
3. Enable editing mode
4. Check browser console for "🔧 Fixed ajaxurl" messages
5. Verify no 404 errors for admin-ajax.php

## 🆘 If You Need Help:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs for any build errors
2. Verify all files were updated correctly
3. Test locally first with `npm run dev`

## 📞 Alternative: Temporary Repository
If easier, I can help you create files for a new temporary Git repository that you can connect to Netlify.
