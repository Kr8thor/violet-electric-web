# WordPress Frontend Editor - Critical Save & Display Issues Fix

## Project Context
I have a WordPress admin interface at `https://wp.violetrainwater.com/wp-admin/` that allows inline editing of a React app at `https://lustrous-dolphin-447351.netlify.app/` through an iframe. The system uses postMessage communication between WordPress and React.

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. **Save Function Not Working** (PRIORITY)
- When I edit content and click "Save All Changes", it shows success but the content doesn't persist
- The WordPress API (`/wp-json/violet/v1/content`) still returns old values
- The save endpoint (`/wp-json/violet/v1/content/save-batch`) appears to succeed but doesn't update the database
- Example: Editing "Change the channel" to "Ramen is the one" shows success but reverts on refresh

### 2. **Save Button Disappears After Clicking**
- Current behavior: Click save → button disappears
- Expected: Button should remain visible but show "Saved!" state, then return to normal
- The button should only hide when there are no pending changes

### 3. **React App Disappears When Disabling Edit Mode**
- Current: Click "Disable Direct Editing" → iframe goes blank
- Expected: React app should remain visible, just remove edit indicators
- Only a full browser refresh brings it back

## Technical Details

### File Locations
- WordPress functions.php: Contains the editor interface and save handlers
- Location: `wp-content/themes/[active-theme]/functions.php`
- Contains functions like:
  - `violet_final_batch_save()` - The save handler
  - `violet_frontend_editor_page_fixed()` - The editor interface
  - `violetSaveAllChanges()` - JavaScript save function

### Current Save Flow
1. User edits content in React iframe
2. Changes tracked in `violetPendingChanges` object
3. Click save → calls `violetSaveAllChanges()`
4. Sends POST to `/wp-json/violet/v1/content/save-batch`
5. Shows success but doesn't persist to database

### API Endpoints
- GET: `https://wp.violetrainwater.com/wp-json/violet/v1/content`
- POST: `https://wp.violetrainwater.com/wp-json/violet/v1/content/save-batch`

## What I Need Fixed

### Priority 1: Fix Save Persistence
1. Debug why `update_option()` isn't persisting values
2. Check if options are being saved with correct names (`violet_` prefix)
3. Verify database write permissions
4. Add logging to track exact save failures
5. Ensure saved values appear in GET endpoint immediately

### Priority 2: Fix Save Button Behavior
```javascript
// Current behavior (WRONG):
if (response.success) {
    saveBtn.style.display = 'none'; // This hides it!
}

// Should be:
if (response.success) {
    saveBtn.innerHTML = '✅ Saved!';
    saveBtn.disabled = false;
    // Keep visible for more changes
}
```

### Priority 3: Fix Disable Edit Mode
The iframe src or content is being cleared when disabling edit mode. Need to ensure:
- React app remains loaded
- Only editing features are disabled
- No iframe refresh or src change

## Test Case
1. Edit hero title from "Change the channel" to "Test Save 123"
2. Click save
3. Verify at `/wp-json/violet/v1/content` shows "Test Save 123"
4. Refresh page - should still show "Test Save 123"
5. Save button should remain visible after save
6. Disable editing - React app should stay visible

## Additional Context
- WordPress user: Leocorbett
- The React app correctly receives and displays content
- The issue is specifically with WordPress persisting the saves
- Using WordPress options API for storage
- JWT authentication is set up and working

## Request
Please analyze the WordPress save function and fix:
1. Why saves aren't persisting to the database
2. Why the save button disappears
3. Why the React app disappears when disabling edit mode

Focus on the WordPress PHP side first, particularly the `violet_final_batch_save()` function and how it's storing options. The React side is working correctly - it's a WordPress persistence issue.
