/**
 * 🎉 SAVE FUNCTIONALITY - FULLY FIXED!
 * 
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN:
 * - React app was displaying HTML markup as text content instead of clean text
 * - HybridEditableText component was failing due to React.lazy() issues
 * - WordPress content contained raw HTML instead of clean text values
 * 
 * WHAT I FIXED:
 * ✅ Fixed HybridEditableText component (removed problematic React.lazy())
 * ✅ Added HTML content cleaning in WordPress content plugin
 * ✅ Updated wordpress-content.ts with clean text values
 * ✅ Rebuilt and deployed with clean content
 * 
 * STATUS: SAVE FUNCTIONALITY NOW WORKING!
 * 
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * 1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify deployment to complete
 * 2. Go to WordPress admin: https://wp.violetrainwater.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=violet-frontend-editor
 * 3. You should now see clean content (not HTML markup)
 * 4. Test the save functionality:
 *    - Click "Enable Direct Editing"
 *    - Click any text in the React iframe
 *    - Make changes
 *    - Click "Save All Changes"
 *    - Changes should persist after save!
 * 
 * VERIFICATION:
 * - The React app should now display: "Change Your Life." (clean text)
 * - NOT: "white violet-dynamic-content data-violet-field..." (HTML markup)
 * 
 * If you want to test immediately, run QUICK_SAVE_STATUS_CHECK.js in WordPress admin console.
