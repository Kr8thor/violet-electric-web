- Try different DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)

**Symptoms:** "Not secure" warning in browser
**Solution:**
- Wait for Netlify to provision certificate (usually < 24 hours)
- Check certificate status in Netlify dashboard

**Solution:**
- Ensure WordPress Site Address is set to violetrainwater.com

- Verify allowed origins include violetrainwater.com

### **Issue 5: API Endpoints Not Working**
