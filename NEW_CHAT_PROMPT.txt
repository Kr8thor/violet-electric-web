# Fix WordPress Frontend Editor - Save & Display Issues

I have a WordPress frontend editor that's not working properly. I need you to fix these issues:

## Issue 1: Save Not Working (CRITICAL)
- When I save content, it shows "✅ Saved 1 fields successfully!" but the content doesn't persist
- The API endpoint `/wp-json/violet/v1/content` still returns old values after saving
- Example: I edit "Change the channel" to "Ramen is the one", save shows success, but API still returns "Change the channel"

## Issue 2: Save Button Disappears
- After clicking save, the save button completely disappears
- It should stay visible and show "✅ All Changes Saved" or similar
- Currently it hides when `violetPendingChanges` is empty

## Issue 3: React App Disappears
- When I click "Disable Direct Editing", the React app in the iframe goes blank
- Only a full browser refresh brings it back
- The iframe should keep showing the React app, just without edit capabilities

## Technical Details
- WordPress site: https://wp.violetrainwater.com
- React app: https://lustrous-dolphin-447351.netlify.app
- The editor is in the WordPress theme's functions.php
- Save endpoint: `/wp-json/violet/v1/content/save-batch`
- Using WordPress options API to store content

## What I Need
1. Fix the save function so content actually persists in the database
2. Keep the save button visible after saving (just change its appearance)
3. Ensure the React app stays visible when disabling edit mode

The save function is called `violet_final_batch_save()` and uses `update_option()` to save. Please help me debug why the saves aren't persisting and fix these UI issues.
