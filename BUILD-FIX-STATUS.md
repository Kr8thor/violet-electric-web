# 🔧 Build Fix Applied - Deployment Restarted

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The Netlify build was failing due to a missing `framer-motion` dependency in the `ContentStatus` component.

### What Was Done:

1. **Removed framer-motion imports** from `ContentStatus.tsx`
2. **Replaced motion components** with regular HTML elements
3. **Added CSS animations** for fade and slide effects
4. **Tested build locally** - confirmed successful
5. **Pushed fix to GitHub** - new deployment triggered

### Build Status:

- **Previous Build**: ❌ Failed (framer-motion not found)
- **Local Test**: ✅ Success (built in 11.15s)
- **New Deployment**: 🔄 In Progress

### Changes Made:

```diff
- import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
+ // Removed framer-motion dependency

- <AnimatePresence>
-   <motion.div>
+ <div className="content-status-fadeIn">
```

### CSS Animations Added:

```css
@keyframes contentStatusFadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}

@keyframes contentStatusSlideIn {
  from { opacity: 0; max-height: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; max-height: 100px; }
}
```

## 📊 Next Steps:

1. **Monitor Netlify Dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com/sites/lustrous-dolphin-447351/deploys
2. **Wait for Build**: Should complete in 2-5 minutes
3. **Verify Deployment**: Check live site once published

## 🎯 Expected Result:

The build should now complete successfully without the framer-motion error. The ContentStatus component will still have smooth animations using CSS instead of framer-motion.

Your Triple Failsafe integration will be live once this deployment completes! 🚀
