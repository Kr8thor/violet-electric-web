WordPress REST API Connectivity Test PRD

Goal: Verify that the WordPress REST API is accessible and functional for both GET and POST requests via the /wp-json/violet/v1/test-auth and /wp-json/violet/v1/rich-content/save endpoints.

Requirements:
- Test GET request to /wp-json/violet/v1/test-auth and confirm valid JSON response.
- Test POST request to /wp-json/violet/v1/rich-content/save with sample data and confirm success response.
- Log results and errors for both requests.
- Ensure CORS and authentication are handled if required.

Success Criteria:
- Both GET and POST requests return expected responses without errors.
- Any issues are logged and reported for debugging.
