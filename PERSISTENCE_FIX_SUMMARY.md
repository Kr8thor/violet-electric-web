# ðŸŽ¯ Content Persistence Fix - COMPLETE

## What Was Fixed
The React app was immediately syncing with WordPress when the page became visible (switching tabs), causing saved content to revert. This has been fixed with a robust content management system that includes:

1. **30-second grace period** after saves where WordPress sync is blocked
2. **Three-tier content state** (WordPress, local, pending)
3. **Smart visibility handling** that respects unsaved changes
4. **Visual status indicator** showing save state

## Files Changed
- `src/contexts/ContentContext.tsx` - Enhanced with state management
- `src/utils/wordpressContentSync.ts` - Removed aggressive syncing
- `src/components/ContentStatus/` - New visual feedback component
- `src/App.tsx` - Added ContentStatus component
- `src/utils/contentDebugTools.ts` - New debug utilities
- `src/utils/debugTools.ts` - Enhanced debug tools
- `src/components/WordPressEditor.tsx` - Fixed import error

## Quick Test
```javascript
// Run in browser console:
violetDebug.simulateSave('hero_title', 'TEST: ' + Date.now());
// Then switch tabs and come back - content should persist!
```

## Debug Commands
```javascript
violetDebug.isInGracePeriod()         // Check if in 30s grace period
violetDebug.getGracePeriodRemaining() // Time left in grace period
violetDebug.getContentState()         // View complete state
violetDebug.forceSync()               // Force WordPress sync
```

## Build Status
âœ… Project builds successfully with no errors
âœ… All TypeScript types are correct
âœ… ContentStatus component integrated

## For New Chat Sessions
"I have a React app with WordPress editing that was reverting content after saves. The issue was that visibility change events were triggering immediate WordPress syncs. This has been fixed with a 30-second grace period system in ContentContext.tsx and smart sync logic. The fix is working but I need help with [specific aspect]."
